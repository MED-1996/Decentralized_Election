# Decentralized Election :bust_in_silhouette:

An ethereum smart contract that allows the deployer to setup an election on the ethereum blockchain. When deploying, the deployer must provide:

* Array of ethereum voter addresses.
* Array of ethereum candidate addresses.
* An election controller ethereum address (responsible for displaying the results of the election).
* How long they'd like the election to last for.

The goal of a decentralized election is to eliminate election fraud. {double voting, votes not being counted properly, when the vote ends, etc.}
